# Change: Improve Documentation Structure and Content

## Why
The mipnix project currently has scattered documentation across README.md, project.md, and various module READMEs. This makes it difficult for new contributors to understand the project structure and for existing team members to quickly find relevant information. The documentation lacks consistency in style, completeness in coverage, and clear navigation paths.

## What Changes
- Standardize documentation structure across all project files
- Create comprehensive documentation for core project concepts
- Improve README.md with clearer usage instructions and visual hierarchy
- Add module-level documentation to explain component purposes
- Implement consistent terminology and formatting

## Impact
- Affected specs: project, documentation, usage
- Affected code: README.md, project.md, module READMEs
