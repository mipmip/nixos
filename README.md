# Nixos for Pim's machine park

This is my mono-repository for my machines configuration and my dotfiles.

_documentation is work in progress_

## Linux Desktop Highlights

I use GNOME as desktop environment with a few extensions to give me some
features I'm used too from the time I used macOS as primary OS.

### Programming and writing

I payed a lot of time optimizing my terminal and vim configuration. I use
[St](https://st.suckless.org) with a few patches for better aesthetics.

My St/Vim writing configuration has a larger line height, a dedicated font, a
pure white background together with a grayscale writing theme. Here's a pic
showing my writing environment.
